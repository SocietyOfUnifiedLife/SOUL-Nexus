**SOUL Coordinator Role Guide**

---

**Purpose:**
The Coordinator is the mission's ethical architect. They don't command — they facilitate, synthesize, and empower. Their job is to ensure that all moving parts align with SOUL's principles, mission goals, and available capacity.

---

**Core Responsibilities:**

1. **Clarify the Mission**

   * Define the goal (e.g., flood relief, food drive, retreat setup)
   * Break the mission into manageable teams or flows

2. **Form Functional Teams**

   * Identify needs (e.g., Supply, Care, Safety, Comms, Welcome)
   * Ask for volunteers or suggest leads based on skill level and availability

3. **Maintain Situational Awareness**

   * Monitor progress, gaps, stress points
   * Float between teams or delegate floating to a support lead

4. **Run Check-ins**

   * Lead short, regular strategy huddles
   * Rotate leads if needed; refresh focus, redistribute load

5. **Protect the Culture**

   * Ensure nonviolence, transparency, and mutual respect remain active
   * Intervene if power starts consolidating or people are burning out

**Team Management Philosophy:**

* **Voluntary First:** Always ask before assigning
* **Skill-Informed, Not Skill-Locked:** Level helps identify experience, not authority
* **Rotate Often:** Avoid fatigue or fixed hierarchies
* **Decentralize When Possible:** Let teams self-manage when able

---

**Team Leads:**

* Team Leads can be selected **during mission planning** if roles and availability are known in advance.
* Alternatively, leads may be selected **on-site at mission startup**, based on who shows up and feels prepared to step in.
* Leads should be chosen with attention to experience level, energy, and willingness. Consent and readiness matter more than status.

* Ready to rotate any leads?
* Emotional/physical energy levels?
* Re-align if mission scope shifts

**Tips for Coordinators:**

* Start calm. Stay grounded. Your tone sets the pace.
* Don't hoard responsibility — spread it.
* Ask questions more than giving orders.
* Keep the mission visible (posters, shared docs, etc.)
* Thank people often.
* Step down when someone else is ready.

**Tools You Might Use:**

* Whiteboard or chalkboard
* Team roster + shift tracker
* Supply list + request form
* Digital comms board (Discord, phone group)
* Mission briefing sheet

**When to Step Back:**

* Another trusted member wants to rotate in
* You feel your presence is limiting others
* You need rest, reflection, or recovery

**Remember:**

> "Leadership is a path, not a pedestal."

Your role is not to control — it's to coordinate clarity, capacity, and compassion.
