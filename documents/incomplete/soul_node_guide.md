# I. Foundation & Orientation

## I.1 - 🧱 Core Premise

> **SOUL Nodes are local expressions of shared values—not fixed chapters of a brand.**

They are formed organically by people who feel called to build something better—quietly, cooperatively, and without permission.

While every Node looks different, they share a common ethical spine and a flexible design philosophy:

* They uphold the core values of **Transparency, Generosity, and Cooperation** in everything they do.
* They operate with **rotating leadership roles**, ensuring no one holds permanent power.
* They choose their own focus—from nature walks to food drives, civic design to trauma healing—by selecting from a shared menu of modular missions and initiatives.
* They **scale flexibly**, adapting structure to local needs. Some remain casual and intimate. Others grow into multi-team ecosystems.

But Nodes don’t exist in isolation.

Each one is part of a global, decentralized web known as the **SOUL Nexus**—a shared commons of tools, stories, and mutual support. When Nodes connect across geography, they may voluntarily form **Constellations**—regional alliances that coordinate events, mentorship, and mutual aid.

Nodes are encouraged to **experiment, adapt, and reflect openly**, knowing their lessons may help others across the network. Every Node contributes to a culture of *distributed wisdom* and *collaborative growth*.

A single individual can begin this journey. From personal alignment comes team cooperation, which evolves into a Node. As more Nodes take shape, their influence expands—not by force, but by *force multiplication*: a quiet, cascading network of mutual aid, leadership development, and healing.

Nodes are also designed to function during moments of crisis. With the right preparation, they can serve as decentralized emergency response teams—sharing resources, supporting neighbors, and operating independently if official systems break down.

Beyond logistics, every Node is a microcosm—an experiment in living differently. Through ritual, culture, and care, they carry the quiet flame of what’s possible.

SOUL does not require uniformity—only integrity. A Node is not defined by what it copies, but by what it embodies. Even a small team of friends, neighbors, or collaborators can call themselves a Node if they operate in this spirit. This foundation ensures that every Node, regardless of its size or format, carries the DNA of SOUL’s deeper purpose.

---

## I.2 - 🔑 Key Terms & Definitions

To fully understand the Node system, here are the core terms used throughout this guide:

* **Node:** A local chapter or group aligned with SOUL values, carrying out missions and building culture.
* **Team:** A smaller, informal group that may evolve into a full Node.
* **Member:** Any aligned individual embodying SOUL values.
* **Constellation:** A regional network of Nodes and/or Teams collaborating on larger efforts.
* **Nexus:** The decentralized global platform where tools, stories, and structures are shared.
* **Foundation:** The formal nonprofit (or equivalent legal structure) that protects the framework legally and fiscally without exerting control.
* **Initiative:** A category of ongoing missions that Nodes can optionally participate in, often with their own coordinators.
* **Mission:** A specific local action or event aligned with SOUL values (e.g., cleanup, care drive, discussion circle).
* **Archetype:** A style of Node based on its primary focus or rhythm (e.g., Explorer, Caregiver, Generalist).
* **Pathway:** A role development track that helps volunteers grow in skill, trust, and contribution (e.g., Peacekeeper Path, Culture Path).
* **Steward:** A Node’s ethical anchor—usually the founder or initiator.
* **Facilitator:** Rotating role that guides meetings or discussions.
* **Coordinator:** Leads a specific mission, gathering, or action.

# II - Governance & Structure

A SOUL Node is not a hierarchy—it’s a living system of mutual care, shared responsibility, and evolving trust. Its vitality depends not just on shared values, but on how those values are lived out through roles, rhythms, and teamwork.

This section explores how decisions are made, roles are held, and human energy is organized—clearly, compassionately, and without bureaucracy—so that leadership can rotate, power remains diffuse, and every member feels empowered to contribute without burnout or confusion.

---

## II.1 - 🏛️ Governance System (Three-Branch Model)

SOUL Nodes are governed by their members through **direct democratic consensus**. Oversight structures exist not to lead, but to safeguard the group’s alignment and integrity.

To support accountability and resilience, each Node may adopt a **three-branch oversight model**. This framework ensures no single voice can dominate, while still allowing the Node to evolve with clarity and care.

The three branches are:

- **🧭 Steward** – Ethical anchor and charter guardian  
- **🪑 Council** – A rotating circle of peer-elected advisors  
- **🗳 Consensus** – The full democratic voice of the Node  

**Oversight roles do not make operational decisions.** Most choices—missions, roles, proposals—are made via **Consensus vote**. Oversight branches hold only one power: the **veto**, used sparingly to prevent misalignment, harm, or structural drift.

Each branch has:

- **Equal veto authority**
- The ability to **override another branch’s veto** (details in Veto Chain)
- No command or executive function—only support and review

This creates a system of shared responsibility where:

- **Day-to-day decisions are made by the group**
- **Oversight serves as a cultural immune system**, not a ruling body
- **Power is diffused**, not concentrated

This balance enables freedom **with integrity**, ensuring every Node can adapt without losing its soul.

---

### II.1.a - 🗳 Consensus System

**Definition:** A full democratic vote of active Node members — one person, one vote.

This is the default method for making decisions within a SOUL Node. It ensures that the group retains full agency over its direction, rhythm, and structure.

#### ✅ Default Thresholds

- **Simple Majority (51%)** for regular decisions:
  - Assigning roles (Facilitator, Coordinator, Councilor)
  - Approving missions or initiatives
  - Adopting internal proposals or budgets

- **Supermajority (66%)** for structural or override decisions:
  - Overriding a Steward or Council veto (see Veto Chain)
  - Amending the Node charter or core values
  - Creating or dissolving a Council

#### 🧭 Facilitated by:
- The currently selected **Facilitator**, who ensures clarity, order, and participation

#### 🛠 Customizable:
- Nodes may define their own thresholds, exceptions, or voting methods in their charter — as long as the process remains transparent, inclusive, and aligned with SOUL values

---

### II.1.b - 🪑 Council Structure

**Purpose:** Oversight and reflection—not daily leadership

- **Size:** Scales with Node (~1 Councilor per 8–12 members, up to 12 max)
- **Term:** 6 months  
  - No back-to-back terms  
  - Must sit out one term before re-election
- **Elected via:** Consensus vote
- **Chair (optional):** Chosen internally to coordinate if Steward steps down
- **Odd numbers recommended** to avoid ties, unless tie-breakers are built in

Councilors are not removable mid-term.

---

### II.2.c 🧑‍⚖️ Steward Role

**Role:** Ethical compass and stabilizing presence. Often the founder or anchor of the Node.

**Duties:**

- Uphold values and protect cultural alignment  
- Serve as charter guardian  
- Act as default Treasurer (unless reassigned)  
- Serve as primary point-of-contact for registration or inter-node coordination  
- Behave like any other member unless intervention is needed  

**Term:** 1 year (default)  
- May step down at any time  
- May re-nominate themselves at end of term (requires group approval)  
- May select a successor or defer to a Council or Consensus vote  
- Cannot be removed mid-term by local vote   

Stewards do **not** make independent operational decisions. They are safeguards, not rulers.

---

### II.2.d - ⚖️ Veto Chain & Conflict Resolution

**Any branch (Steward, Council, or Consensus) may veto a proposal.**  
That veto may then be overridden by **either of the other two**:

- **Consensus override** requires **supermajority (66%)**  
- **Council override** requires **simple majority**  
- **Steward override** is **unilateral**

Once overridden, the **third branch may re-veto**, and that decision is **final**.

If only two branches exist, a second veto by the other is final.  
If no action is taken by the third branch, the last override stands.

---

### II.2.e - 🎯 Example Flow

1. Proposal passes Consensus (51%)  
2. Steward vetoes  
3. Consensus re-approves (66%)  
4. Council re-vetoes → final veto stands

---

### II.2.f - 📊 Summary Voting Table

| Decision Type                       | Threshold / Rule                            |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Assign roles / approve missions    | Simple Majority (51%)                       |
| Override proposal / decision       | Any two branches (last to veto stands)      |
| Resolve 3-way conflict             | Third branch decides by standard process    |
| If no Council                      | Steward may be overridden by 66% Consensus  |

---

## II.3 - 🗳 Voting System

In a SOUL Node, the **Consensus branch**—all active members—holds primary decision-making authority. Every member has one vote, and decisions follow a clearly defined and accountable process to ensure fairness, flexibility, and alignment.

---

### II.3.a - 🔁 How Proposals Work

Any member may submit a proposal to the current **Facilitator** for inclusion in the next meeting. The Facilitator is responsible for:

- Reviewing the proposal and adding it to the agenda  
- Reading it aloud during the meeting  
- Ensuring space for **discussion and clarifying questions** before the vote  

---

### II.3.b - 📣 Establishing Quorum

To ensure decisions reflect the Node’s active membership:

- **Quorum** is the minimum number of active members required to hold a valid vote  
- Suggested defaults:  
  - **50% of active members** for regular votes (e.g. roles, missions, budgets)  
  - **66% of active members** for structural or override votes (e.g. veto overrides, charter amendments)  

If quorum is **not met**:  
- The vote may still be held **provisionally**  
- The result must be **ratified** by additional members outside the meeting or re-voted when quorum is next met  

This prevents inaction due to low attendance while still respecting democratic legitimacy.

---

### II.3.c - 📋 Voting Procedure

1. **Proposal Presented** – Facilitator introduces and reads the motion  
2. **Discussion Period** – Members may ask questions, suggest edits, or debate respectfully  
3. **Quorum Check** – Facilitator confirms that enough members are present  
4. **Call to Vote** – Vote is held via show of hands, digital tools, or verbal agreement  
5. **Tally & Record** – Facilitator ensures vote is counted and **documented** in meeting minutes  

> The Facilitator must ensure **someone is designated to take notes**, even if it’s not themselves.

---

### II.3.d - ✅ Default Thresholds

| Vote Type                        | Required Outcome        |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Regular decisions                | Simple Majority (51%)   |
| Structural / override decisions  | Supermajority (66%)     |

Nodes may define **custom thresholds** in their Charter if desired.

---

### II.3.e - 🛡️ Post-Vote Oversight

Once a motion **passes**, it enters a **brief review period**, where any oversight branch (Steward or Council) may:

- **Request clarification or modifications**  
- **Veto** the motion if it is clearly misaligned with SOUL’s core values or culture  

By default, Nodes operate under a posture of:

> **“It’s good unless anyone speaks up.”**

This supports momentum without requiring pre-approval for every decision.

However, **larger missions**, structural changes, or sensitive issues should be flagged for **early review** by oversight—especially when risk, resources, or values are involved.

---

### II.3.f - 🧠 Cultural Considerations

- **Oversight exists to prevent harm or drift**, not to manage every choice  
- **Facilitators are not decision-makers**, but stewards of fair process  
- **All members are invited to shape direction** through respectful engagement  

---

## II.4 - 👥 Accountability Circles

Every leadership role—whether short-term (like a mission Coordinator) or recurring (like Facilitator)—requires an **Accountability Circle** of **2–5 trusted peers** before officially beginning.

---

### II.4.a - 🛠️ Responsibilities

- **Oversight** – Observe and ensure alignment with SOUL’s culture and charter  
- **Support** – Act as a sounding board, help prevent burnout, and offer personal backup  
- **Mentoring** – Provide guidance, especially for first-time or rotating leaders  
- **Reporting** – Provide occasional role reflections or ratings (1–5), with short notes  
- **Intervention (if needed)** – May pause a role-holder’s authority for serious issues; triggers follow-up review  

Circles help **nurture leaders**, not just monitor them.

---

### II.4.b - 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Formation Process

- Role-holders must **form their Circle before beginning duties**
- The Circle can be proposed by the person themselves *or* by trusted peers
- The person **may veto** specific individuals (e.g. conflicts of trust or ethics)
- Final approval is done **by the Council, Steward, or Facilitator**, depending on the context

This prevents bias while still **respecting personal boundaries** and **ensuring readiness**.

---

### II.4.c - 📊 Optional Feedback System

To improve leadership continuity and culture, Circles may provide **periodic feedback**:

- **Numerical rating (1–5)** on alignment, reliability, presence, etc.  
- **Brief qualitative notes** (what’s working, what’s strained, what’s inspiring)  
- Reports may be reviewed by the Node’s governance branch(es) or archived for internal growth  

This supports **pattern awareness** without enforcing judgment or fostering competition.  
If desired, Nodes can rotate **anonymous peer evaluations** or conduct occasional debriefs instead.


---

### II.4.d - 🌿 Cultural Principles

- Authority is temporary, accountable, and service-based  
- Stewards and Councilors are **safeguards**, not rulers  
- Consensus is the **core engine** of collective alignment  
- Peer review encourages growth, not punishment  
- Transparency, humility, and respect ground all governance  

















































---

## 🔄 1. Rotating Role Philosophy

* Roles are **functional, not positional**—they exist to serve a purpose, not claim power.
* Every role is **rotatable** to distribute trust, reduce dependence, and encourage growth.
* **No role is permanent**, and every person should feel free to try, rest, or shift.
* Rotation trains and spreads experience across the Node—reinforcing resilience, redundancy, and the spirit of **force multiplication**.

### Rotation Patterns

* Facilitator: weekly / per-meeting
* Coordinator: per mission
* Treasurer: optional annual or seasonal check-in
* Steward: rotatable or long-term, if desired

There is no problem with a Node having a favorite Facilitator—as long as they are *chosen* and not *clinging* to the position. People may **volunteer** or be **nominated**, but must be **approved**—usually by consensus, Steward, or Council (or some hybrid).

Approval is only valid for a **set period of time**, after which a new person is selected through the same process.

---

### 🧭 2. The Steward (Default Anchor Role)

The **Steward** is the ethical compass and stabilizing presence of a Node—often the founder or first organizer. This person:

- Upholds SOUL values and protects cultural alignment  
- Acts as the **default treasurer** (unless another is chosen)  
- Serves as the primary point of contact for coordination or registration  
- Supports smooth role rotation and group health  

A Steward may also fill other roles in small or early-stage Nodes (e.g., Facilitator, Coordinator).

A Steward may step back or be replaced as the Node evolves.

---

### 🪞 3. Oversight Circle (Optional or Elected)

As Nodes grow, they’re encouraged to form an **Oversight Circle**—a small group of trusted peers who:

- Reflect regularly with the Steward or other leaders  
- Offer feedback, mentorship, and perspective  
- **Can vote (by consensus or majority) to relieve a Steward** if misalignment or misconduct arises  

If the Steward steps down, the Oversight Circle may:

- Assume leadership as a council  
- Appoint a rotating **Chair**, who becomes the new point of contact and treasurer by default  

This structure helps Nodes stay aligned even as founders step away.

---

### 🪜 3. Facilitators (Rotating Meeting Hosts)

**Facilitators** ensure that meetings run smoothly, inclusively, and on time. They are not leaders in a power sense—they simply host the flow.

Typical responsibilities:

- Secure and prepare meeting spaces (in-person or digital)  
- Guide timing, agenda flow, and respectful conversation  
- Ensure everyone feels heard and welcomed  

Facilitators rotate frequently (weekly, monthly, or by rhythm), preventing dependence on any one person.

---

### 🧭 4. Coordinators (Mission Leads)

**Coordinators** lead specific missions, gatherings, or events. They:

- Propose or clarify the mission’s goals  
- Assemble teams, distribute roles, and track needs  
- Handle day-of logistics and communication  
- Reflect and debrief with participants afterward  

Their authority is temporary and task-based—dissolving when the mission ends.

---

### 🧩 5. Accountability Circles (Fractal Peer Review)

At every level—from Node to Constellation to Nexus—roles are held accountable by **Accountability Circles**: small peer groups that reflect, review, and realign when needed.

For example:

- A Steward may be accountable to former Stewards or the Oversight Circle  
- A Coordinator may be accountable to past mission leads or a mission review group  
- A Nexus Facilitator may be accountable to facilitators across other regions  

These circles:

- Encourage regular peer feedback  
- May vote to pause or rotate someone out of a role if harm or misalignment occurs  
- Help build trust without centralized enforcement

---

### 💰 Money & Resources

SOUL encourages financial transparency without creating bureaucracy.

- By default, the **Steward is the Treasurer**, unless another is chosen  
- Funds are collectively stewarded for mission-related needs  
- Expenses and donations should be documented openly  
- Registered Nodes may be required to submit periodic reports to the Foundation  

Simple tools will eventually be provided to make this easy.

---

### 📝 Documentation & Transparency

While not required unless officially registered, documentation is encouraged:

- Who is holding what role  
- What decisions were made and why  
- What funds were received or spent  
- What missions succeeded, struggled, or inspired  

This helps Nodes rotate leadership, avoid confusion, and share their story with others.

But documentation is also a **signal of integrity**—not just internally for registration or reflection, but **externally**, for the community at large. Sharing your processes, expenses, and progress openly builds public trust, invites collaboration, and protects against misunderstanding or suspicion.

We aim to stand with clarity in the open. Each Node is free to choose its own level of disclosure, but **transparency is a quiet form of leadership.**

---

### 🪶 Summary Table

| Role            | Appointed By          | Duration               | Can Be Removed By                  |
|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Steward**     | Self or group         | Indefinite (rotatable) | Oversight Circle or consensus vote |
| **Facilitator** | Rotating / selected   | 1 meeting or period    | Group feedback or rhythm reset     |
| **Coordinator** | Self or team-assigned | Mission-based          | Mission team or Steward            |
| **Treasurer**   | Steward by default    | Ongoing or assigned    | Oversight Circle or reassignment   |

---

In SOUL, **authority is always tied to responsibility—not title.**  
And responsibility is always held in relationship—with others, with values, and with care.

---

# III. Node Archetypes Guide

## Why Archetypes?

SOUL Nodes are meant to be flexible, adaptable, and rooted in local needs. There’s no one right way to do this. That said, some common patterns emerge—and it helps to name them. These archetypes are not strict categories, but helpful lenses to design from.

You can mix and match from any dimension below. Let your Node’s identity evolve over time.

---

## 🌟 1. Mission Focus

*What does your Node **do** most of the time?*

- 🎒 **Explorer** – Nature, reflection, stewardship, permaculture, outdoor retreats  
- 🥣 **Caregiver** – Outreach, healing, mutual aid, trauma circles  
- 🗳 **Designer** – Civic forums, policy workshops, governance labs  
- 📚 **Learner** – Study groups, skillshares, shared education spaces  
- 🎭 **Culturalist** – Social events, storytelling, art nights, seasonal celebrations  
- 🔄 **Generalist** – Rotating focus depending on season or needs  
- 🧩 **Fractal** – Multi-team or multi-focus structure for large or diverse communities  

> *Nodes can begin with one focus and evolve naturally.*

---

## 🌐 2. Engagement Mode

*How does your Node meet and connect?*

- 🧍‍♂️ **In-Person** – Physical gatherings in your local community  
- 💻 **Online** – Virtual-first Node via Zoom, Discord, etc.  
- 🌐 **Hybrid** – Mix of online and in-person, flexible by season or need  

> *Your medium of engagement will shape your accessibility and rhythm.*

---

## 🛠 3. Governance Style

*How are decisions made and responsibilities held?*

- 🧭 **Steward-Led** – A trusted individual maintains vision & direction  
- 🛡️ **Council-Led** – A group of trusted members co-leads equally  
- 🗳 **Consensus-Based** – Pure democratic or consensus decision-making  
- 🧬 **Hybrid** – Custom blend based on what fits the team  

> *No system is perfect—what matters is trust, clarity, and realignment.*

---

## 📅 4. Rhythm & Energy

*How does your Node flow through time?*

- 🌀 **Continuous** – Regular, ongoing rhythm (weekly, biweekly)  
- 🧘 **Low-Burn** – Persistent but low-pressure engagement  
- 🔄 **Seasonal** – Planning and rotating missions by season  
- 🌱 **As-Needed** – Activates in response to events or needs  

> *Rhythm can change. Listen to your energy.*

---

## 🔷 5. Scale & Complexity

*What’s your Node’s current scope, structure, and ambition?*

- 🔹 **Seed Node** — A few trusted individuals, informal rhythm, just beginning to build trust and clarity.  
- 🔸 **Circle Node** — A small team (5–12) with regular meetings and one or two initiatives. Roles may rotate casually.  
- 🔶 **Cluster Node** — Multiple initiative teams operating under a shared identity. May have rotating leadership, basic documentation, or early-stage substructure.  
- 🔷 **Fractal Node** — A large, complex node with multiple teams, Coordinators, active Initiatives, and possibly its own internal Constellation. May host public events, mentor other nodes, or serve as a regional hub.  

> *Scaling is optional. Some Seeds stay powerful by staying small.*

---

## 🧭 Putting It Together

Think of archetypes as a design sketch:

> *“We’re a Caregiver Node with a Council model, meeting weekly in person, rotating seasonally, and maintaining two active initiatives.”*

Or:

> *“We’re an Online Learner Node focused on civic design, steward-led, low-pressure, and flexible in rhythm.”*

You’re allowed to change, evolve, experiment. These are reference points—not rules.

---

## 🌟 Summary Table

| Dimension        | Options (Examples)                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Mission Focus    | Explorer, Caregiver, Designer, Learner, Culturalist |
| Engagement Mode  | In-Person, Online, Hybrid                           |
| Governance Style | Steward-Led, Council, Consensus, Hybrid             |
| Rhythm & Energy  | Continuous, Low-Burn, Seasonal, As-Needed           |
| Scale            | Seed, Circle, Cluster, Fractal                      |

Use what resonates. Ignore what doesn’t. Your Node is yours to shape.

---

## 🧭 2. Core Roles Deep Dive

### **Steward**

> Ethical anchor and default point-of-contact

* Maintains alignment with SOUL values
* Supports rotation, health, and cultural integrity
* Acts as guardian of the Node’s charter
* May act as Treasurer or take on other roles in small teams
* **Not an executive**: serves as a safeguard, not a decision-maker

The Steward behaves like any other member unless intervention is required.

### **Facilitator**

> Meeting host and spaceholder

* Sets the agenda or structure
* Ensures equal participation and emotional safety
* Maintains meeting records or minutes
* Rotates frequently

### **Coordinator**

> Mission lead and team organizer

* Proposes and guides a mission or initiative
* Forms teams, delegates roles, tracks progress
* Handles day-of logistics and follow-ups
* Responsible for volunteer records, safety forms, and after-action reflections
* Role ends at the close of the mission/initiative unless re-selected

### **Treasurer (Optional)**

> Resource steward

* May be fulfilled by the Steward or another trusted person
* Manages shared funds or materials (if any)
* Reports transparently to the group

### **Chair (Oversight Circle)**

> Temporary point-of-contact during leadership transitions

* Chosen by the Oversight Circle if the Steward steps down
* May coordinate council functions or help onboard new Stewards

---

## 🧪 3. Optional Sub-Roles & Teams

Nodes may experiment with sub-teams to support larger missions or recurring needs:

| Team       | Focus                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 👐 Care    | Emotional check-ins, peer support                  |
| 📣 Comms   | Outreach, invitations, announcements               |
| 🧰 Supply  | Logistics, materials, and setup                    |
| 🕊 Culture | Rituals, art, and tone-setting                     |
| 🛡 Safety  | Risk assessment, basic first aid, protection norms |

---

## 🌀 4. Coordination Norms

* **Forming a Mission Team:**
  Coordinator proposes → group consents → roles filled → mission launched

* **During Execution:**
  Use check-ins, shared docs, and responsive comms. Stay adaptable.

* **After Action:**
  Reflect together. What worked? What didn’t? What surprised you? Document and share.

### Mission and Initiative Voting

* Missions, initiatives, and who coordinates them should be decided by the Node as a whole—or at least by the participants involved.
* Stewards and Councils serve primarily as **veto authorities and safety checks**, not active leaders.
* They can remove or realign coordinators through the same process as an accountability circle—acting on behalf of the Node’s overall integrity.

---

## 🌱 5. Leadership as Stewardship

* All leadership is **temporary, voluntary, and in service** of the group.
* Titles do not confer rank.
* Coordinators and Facilitators should be **models of humility, presence, and clarity**—not command.
* Stewards and Councils exist to safeguard—not steer—unless needed.

---

##

---

## 🚀 Missions & Initiatives

*Turning alignment into action.*

### 🧝 What Is a Mission?

A **mission** is any focused, real-world action taken by a Node or Team to serve, care, protect, restore, or connect—aligned with SOUL values.

Examples:

* A park cleanup
* A food drive
* A homeless outreach
* A civic dialogue event

Missions can be simple or complex, recurring or one-time. What matters is the *intent* behind them: clarity, care, and cooperation.

---

### 📋 Mission Proposal Process

Any member may propose a mission during a meeting or planning thread. Proposals should include:

* **What**: Clear purpose or objective
* **When/Where**: Time and location
* **Who**: A proposed **Coordinator** (can be the proposer)
* **How**: What teams, skills, or supplies might be needed

The chapter may:

* Ask clarifying questions
* Suggest improvements
* Vote via soft consensus or majority

Once approved, the Coordinator begins the planning phase.

### 🧍‍♂️ The Coordinator Role

The **Coordinator** facilitates the mission—they guide, they don’t command.

**Responsibilities:**

* Clarify the mission scope and timeline
* Form functional teams (e.g. Supply, Care, Safety, Comms)
* Identify or recruit Team Leads (voluntary and skill-informed)
* Handle logistics, supplies, location prep
* Maintain situational awareness on-site
* Lead brief check-ins every 2–3 hours during the mission
* Protect group culture and emotional energy
* Oversee documentation or delegate to a Recorder
* Debrief with the team and rotate out if needed

Coordinators are confirmed by vote, and may step down or rotate at any time.

### 🛠️ Mission Planning & Flow

#### Preparation Phase

* Confirm date/time/location
* Communicate roles, rally points, and supplies
* Prepare or borrow materials (trash bags, kits, signs, etc.)
* Clarify safety needs, fallback plans, and contact chains

#### On-Site Launch

* Coordinator greets all attendees
* State the mission purpose and safety expectations
* Form or confirm teams (Supply, Care, Safety, etc.)
* Establish comms plan (in-person, Discord, etc.)
* Post or share check-in schedule (e.g. every 2 hours)

#### Mission in Action

* Teams operate semi-autonomously
* Coordinator floats between teams, monitors flow
* Leads report status during check-ins
* Rotations happen if energy drops or tensions arise

#### Wrap-Up

* Debrief circle: What worked? What needs adjusting?
* Gratitude and acknowledgments
* Share photos, quotes, or insights to internal or public channels

### 🧹 What Are Initiatives?

**Initiatives** are ongoing themed campaigns that Nodes can align with—like collaborative categories of action.

They:

* Offer continuity across time and space
* Make missions more visible and recognizable
* Encourage creative local adaptation

Examples:

* 🥣 **CleanSOUL** — Environmental cleanup & restoration
* 🕳 **RECLAIM** — Civic listening, public design, cultural dialogue
* 🌾 **SOUL Pantries** — Food security, mutual aid, gifting fridges
* 🔥 **Ritual Circles** — Story, ceremony, spiritual practice
* 👁 **SOUL Watch** — Nonviolent observation, de-escalation

Nodes may tag their mission names accordingly (e.g. "🕳 RECLAIM: Community Listening Circle").

#### Creating or Ending Initiatives

New initiatives can be proposed during reflection circles or to the Nexus. Retired ones may be archived in the global mission ledger.

Optional: Initiative Coordinators can emerge to offer mentorship, documentation, and shared tooling.

---

### 🌀 Mission Rhythms & Seasonal Flow

To prevent burnout and encourage sustainable action, Nodes are encouraged to:

* Vary mission scale and energy levels
* Balance indoor/outdoor, social/quiet, public/private service
* Rest and rotate leadership regularly
* Reflect and adapt seasonally (e.g. spring = CleanSOUL; fall = Ritual Circles)

---

### 📝 After the Mission

Each mission is a chance to learn and improve.

**Basic Debrief Flow:**

* What went well?
* What was hard or unclear?
* Any surprising moments?
* Suggestions for next time?

**Optional Documentation:**

* Photos or quotes
* Lessons learned
* Team list or role rotation summary
* Resource needs or inventory notes

Missions may also be added to the **After Action Archive** in the Nexus.

> A mission is not just something we do.
> It is how we *become* together.

Even one hour of clear, caring action can ripple across time.
You don’t have to be perfect.
You just have to begin.
