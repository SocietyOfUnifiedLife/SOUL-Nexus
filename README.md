# SOUL Nexus

**A decentralized humanitarian framework for global cooperation, resilience, and ethical coordination.**

---

## What Is This?

This repository is the evolving **core library** of the SOUL Nexus—the digital backbone of the [Society of Unified Life (SOUL)](https://societyofunifiedlife.github.io/SOUL-Website/).

It is currently under active development and contains early drafts of SOUL’s foundational documents, roles, structures, protocols, and strategies. Over time, this will become the living archive that supports:

- Node creation and coordination
- Regional and global transparency
- Emergency response protocols
- Role training and certification
- Philosophical alignment and cultural continuity

---

## Current Structure

Content is organized into:

- `documents/incomplete/` – Working drafts of all core modules
- `documents/official/` – Finalized or public-facing versions (in progress)

Expect frequent updates, additions, and restructures during this early phase.

---

## How to Use

You are welcome to:

- **Browse** the documents for inspiration, structure, or ideas
- **Fork or clone** the repo for your own local chapter or aligned project
- **Share feedback** via issues or Discord if you spot a way to improve clarity or structure

All documents are released openly and are free to adapt under a public domain license.
