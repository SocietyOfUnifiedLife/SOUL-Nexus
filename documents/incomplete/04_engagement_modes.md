# **SOUL Role & Engagement Model (Simplified Framework)**

---

## 🧭 Overview

SOUL (Society of Unified Life) is a decentralized, open-source experiment in peaceful cooperation and grassroots service. Participation is fluid, non-hierarchical, and always voluntary. There are no paywalls, no status tiers, and no exclusivity. Everyone contributes in their own way—and all forms of sincere engagement are welcome.

This document outlines the three broad modes of engagement: **Observer**, **Member**, and **Volunteer**.

---

## 🕊️ Observer — *Those who watch*

Everyone begins as an Observer.

* Observers follow the work, explore the ideas, or join the Discord without committing to anything.
* They are not outsiders—they are the quiet periphery of alignment.
* No registration, cost, or participation required.

**Contribution:** Attention, reflection, curiosity

---

## 🧭 Member — *Those who participate*

Members are those who choose to align with SOUL's intent and actively engage.

* Self-selected: becoming a member requires no application, approval, or fee
* May participate in discussions, join SOUL events, attend reflection circles or help shape direction
* May invite others, form teams, or start informal missions

**Contribution:** Alignment, presence, initiative

Membership is open to all who act with care and resonate with SOUL's mission. A member may adopt the Statement of Intent to affirm their alignment, but it is not required.

## 💕 Volunteer — *Those who build*

Volunteers are members who contribute time, energy, or skill to help grow and sustain SOUL. There are three levels of volunteer engagement, based on scope and responsibility:

### Tier 1: Informal Volunteer

* Offers support, creativity, or manual help without leading others
* Examples: digital moderation, event help, content creation, care circles
* No registration required

**Contribution:** Energy, assistance, goodwill

---

### Tier 2: Mission Lead

* Organizes informal events or initiatives, online or locally
* Coordinates with others or acts under the SOUL name
* May be encouraged to review safety principles or submit short reports

**Contribution:** Leadership, coordination, initiative

---

### Tier 3: Steward / Node Founder

* Establishes formal SOUL chapters (Nodes)
* May speak publicly, manage funds, or accept legal responsibility
* Required to register basic info and affirm a Statement of Responsibility

**Contribution:** Stewardship, accountability, infrastructure

---

## 💸 Donations & Support

Donating is welcome—but does not define a role. Financial support helps fuel the work, but SOUL does not distinguish participants based on money.

* All resources are public and free
* No perks, paywalls, or elevated status
* Gratitude is offered, not access

You support SOUL most by participating, sharing, reflecting, and helping build it with care.

---

## 🔁 Participation Flow

* **Observer** → Learns and listens
* **Member** → Chooses to align and participate
* **Volunteer** → Contributes time or takes on a role

Anyone can move between roles freely. No path is superior—just different kinds of contribution.

## 🧠 Final Notes

SOUL is not built on status. It grows through alignment, clarity, and shared responsibility. Whether you are quietly observing or actively helping build the next chapter, your presence matters.

Start where you are. Stay aligned. Let your actions speak.

**We stand together.**
