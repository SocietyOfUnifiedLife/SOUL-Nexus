## SOUL Chapter Structural Archetypes

SOUL chapters are encouraged to adopt whichever structure best suits their local context, membership size, and operational style. The only requirement is maintaining accountability, coordination, and clarity. Below are several proven archetypes:

---

### 1. **Flat Model**

* **Description:** Fully decentralized, emphasizing consensus and collective decision-making.
* **Roles:**

  * Rotating Facilitator (meeting management)
  * Ad-hoc Mission Coordinators
  * Accountability Circle (volunteer-based, rotating)
* **Ideal For:** Small, highly cohesive groups that value absolute equality.
* **Pros:**

  * Maximum equality and autonomy.
  * Encourages personal responsibility.
* **Cons:**

  * Difficult to scale or make quick decisions.
  * Requires high trust and maturity.

### 2. **Guardian-Led Model**

* **Description:** Structured around one Steward (Guardian) and support roles, ensuring clear leadership and rapid decision-making.
* **Roles:**

  * Steward (Guardian)
  * Mission Coordinators (appointed by Steward or elected)
  * Accountability Circle (oversight of Steward)
* **Ideal For:** Medium-sized chapters needing decisive leadership and clear vision.
* **Pros:**

  * Strong, clear leadership.
  * Quick decisions in critical situations.
* **Cons:**

### SOUL Structural Experimentation Framework

**Purpose:**
To continuously improve decentralized organization by openly sharing experiences, lessons learned, and strategies across chapters.

**How It Works:**

* **Document Your Journey:**
  Every chapter records their chosen structure, rationale, and outcomes clearly.

* **Share Openly:**
  Reports are shared via a dedicated online hub or central wiki—accessible to all.

* **Reflect and Improve:**
  Regular meetings (monthly/quarterly) to discuss what's effective, what's challenging, and potential adjustments.

* **Dynamic Recommendations:**
  The structural archetypes evolve naturally as chapters experiment, reflect, and innovate, based on real-world feedback.

### Guiding Principles for All Structures:

* **Accountability:** Always maintain clear oversight mechanisms.
* **Transparency:** Open documentation and decision-making.
* **Adaptability:** Regularly revisit and adjust your structure as needed.

These archetypes are intended as flexible guidelines, not rigid rules—use and adapt them freely to best suit your community's needs.
