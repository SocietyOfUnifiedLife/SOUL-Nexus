**SOUL Financial Strategy Document**

## Three-Phase Financial Strategy Overview

The Society of Unified Life (SOUL) will grow through a transparent, ethical funding progression:

### Phase 1: Seed the Vision

**Ask:** Support the founder (Aaron) so he can build this full-time.

#### ✅ Use of Funds:

* Modest personal compensation (living wage)
* Equipment (camera, mic, editing software)
* Discord infrastructure & bots
* Website & email platform
* Legal setup (fiscal sponsor or 501(c)(3))
* Content development (YouTube Shorts, writing)

#### Financial Goal:

**\$2,000–\$4,000/month** minimum

#### Messaging:

> "Right now, this vision needs a builder. I’m asking for your support to give it the time, tools, and energy it deserves. I’ll show you exactly where the money goes—and how it helps bring SOUL into the world."

### Phase 2: Grow the Org

**Ask:** Support the Society so it can scale ethically.

#### ✅ Use of Funds:

* Expanded team (part-time or full-time collaborators)
* Design, editing, or animation support
* App prototyping (interactive playbook)
* Chapter starter kits (templates, art, badges)
* Legal filing and accounting
* Public audit dashboards and reports

#### Financial Goal:

**\$5,000–\$12,000/month**

#### Messaging:

> "We’ve built the foundation. Now we need to grow with integrity—training new leaders, funding open tools, and reaching more people without selling out or going corporate."

### Phase 3: Empower the Chapters

**Ask:** Support your local chapter—or help others launch theirs.

#### ✅ Use of Funds:

* Supplies for local service missions
* Permits and event logistics
* First aid kits, safety gear
* Node-based grants
* Printed materials & local outreach
* Travel stipends for volunteers

#### Financial Model:

* Global fund to seed new nodes
* Patreon tiers to support local or global action
* Open ledger or dashboard to track flows

#### Messaging:

> "This is what you’ve been waiting for—real-world action in your own backyard. Every dollar now supports decentralized service: gardens planted, trash picked up, neighbors helped."
