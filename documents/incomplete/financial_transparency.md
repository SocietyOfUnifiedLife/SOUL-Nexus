**SOUL Financial Transparency System (Draft v0.1)**

---

## 🔍 Core Principles

1. **Open by Default**
   All financial records and activity (except private/sensitive information) should be made available to the public and/or contributors.

2. **Receipts or It Didn’t Happen**
   Every transaction should have an accompanying photo, screenshot, or receipt.

3. **Track to the Penny**
   Exact numbers inspire more trust than round ones. Precision shows care and diligence.

4. **Shared Oversight**
   Peer review and optional third-party auditing should be encouraged, even early on.

## 📊 Startup-Phase Ledger (Simple System)

Use a **public Google Sheet**, Notion database, or Airtable to track all income and expenses. It should be easy to read, publicly accessible, and updated regularly.

### Recommended Ledger Columns:

* **Date**
* **Transaction Type** (income, expense, transfer)
* **Amount**
* **Category** (Humanitarian, Savings, Ops, Admin)
* **Method** (Patreon, CashApp, Ko-fi, etc.)
* **Description**
* **Receipt Link (optional)**
* **Verified By (optional)**

Color-code entries based on category for visual clarity.

## 📦 The 33/33/33 Model

When funds are received, divide as follows (adjustable during emergencies or startup milestones):

* ✅ **33% Humanitarian**
  Direct giving, field missions, care packages, community events, supplies for outreach.

* ✅ **33% Savings/Reserves**
  Emergency fund, future scaling, legal incorporation, land or equipment purchases, disaster prep.

* ✅ **33% Operational Growth**
  Infrastructure, gear, marketing, software/tools, founder pay (as a portion of this slice), chapter expenses.

> Note: During startup, a portion of Savings may be diverted to cover legal formation (LLC/501c3).

## 🛠️ Future Tools for Scaling

Once consistent support is reached, integrate tools like:

* **OpenCollective** for full transparency with donor visibility and auto-public ledgers.
* **Expensify** or **Wave** for receipt storage and automated tracking.
* **QuickBooks Nonprofit** for larger-scale accounting.
* **Gitcoin-style blockchain tools** for optional public transparency and verifiability.

## 🙋 Founder Commitments

As the acting founder:

* Narrate major uses of funds with photos, videos, and short logs
* Maintain an accurate, organized ledger from day one
* Be open about challenges, limitations, or changes in budget structure
* Encourage feedback and community improvement of the system

> You don’t have to be perfect—just transparent and accountable.
